# Choose Framework
> **Input**: i want to create an api for an ecommerce service with only 3 features:
(1) products; sort by price, add products to shoping cart
(2) shoping cart; list products added, change quantity of added products, get total price
(3) accept stripe payments
Please do not write any code yet, first let analyze which python framework is best for accomplish this task and why

**Output**: To analyze which Python framework would be best for creating an e-commerce API with the features you've described, let's consider some popular options and their strengths:

1. Django REST Framework (DRF):
   - Built on top of Django, a full-featured web framework
   - Excellent for rapid development of complex APIs
   - Comes with a powerful ORM for database operations
   - Built-in authentication and permission systems
   - Serialization support for complex data types
   - Integrates well with other Django features like admin interface

2. Flask with Flask-RESTful:
   - Lightweight and flexible
   - Easy to set up and get started
   - Good for smaller to medium-sized projects
   - Allows more control over the project structure
   - Can be extended with various plugins for additional functionality

3. FastAPI:
   - Modern, fast (high-performance) framework
   - Built for creating APIs with Python 3.6+
   - Automatic API documentation with Swagger UI
   - Type hints and data validation out of the box
   - Asynchronous support

For your specific requirements, I would recommend using Django REST Framework for the following reasons:

1. Built-in features: Django and DRF provide many built-in features that align well with e-commerce needs, such as user authentication, database models, and admin interfaces.

2. ORM capabilities: Django's ORM will make it easy to create and manage product and shopping cart models, including sorting and filtering products by price.

3. Serialization: DRF's serialization system will be helpful for handling product data and shopping cart information.

4. Scalability: While your current requirements are limited to 3 features, Django and DRF can easily accommodate future expansions of your e-commerce service.

5. Third-party integrations: There are many Django packages available for e-commerce functionalities, including Stripe payment integration (e.g., django-stripe-payments).

6. Security: Django has robust security features out of the box, which is crucial for e-commerce applications handling sensitive customer and payment data.

7. Community and documentation: Django and DRF have large, active communities and extensive documentation, which can be invaluable when developing and maintaining your API.

While Flask or FastAPI could also be used to build this API, Django REST Framework's feature set and ecosystem make it particularly well-suited for e-commerce applications, even with a limited initial feature set. It provides a solid foundation that can grow with your project as you potentially add more features in the future.
